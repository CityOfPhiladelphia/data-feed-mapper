The data also includes the following information for financial assistance provided during the reporting period: the city agency providing the assistance; the type of assistance; the recipient of the assistance and the amount of the assistance. The amount of the assistance detailed in the data reflects the total amount of the deal (ex: bond, loan) for which financial assistance was rendered. If the current term amended a previous contract during its term (e.g. to modify the scope of services), the entry reflects the terms of the current contract, as so amended.<br /><br />Contracts that show a $0 dollar contract amount may reflect instances in which payments are not rendered through any appropriations or in which the original contract was amended to extend the contract term without additional money added.<br /><br />Contracts that show payments greater than the contract amount may reflect the following: instances in which payments for services rendered under a prior contract term are being made during the reporting period; or, instances in which payments are not rendered through the City of Philadelphia's Financial Accounting Management Information System.<br /><br />Negative contract amounts reflect instances in which the amendment reduced the amount of the prior contract term.<br /><br />'General Consultant Services under $30,000' are contracts for $30,000 or less and may include, but are not limited to, services in the following categories: architect and engineer services, audio visual and display services, behavioral health-mental retardation services, computer and information services, health-related services, homelessness-related services, general consultant services, legal services, and personnel-related services.<br /><br />Information on sole source contracts, managed by the Procurement Department, is extracted from several information systems. Due to limitations with these specific systems, it is difficult to obtain the same information for these contracts as for other non- competitively bid contracts. Below you will find an explanation of the difference in the information presented.<br /><br />Certain sole source contracts are displayed as four-year contracts, due to limitations in the reporting systems; however, all sole source contracts are subject to the same renewal provisions as other contracts (one base year term with three options to renew for additional year-long terms). No sole source contract term (unless noted) is for greater than twelve months.<br /><br />The days remaining column is calculated using the stated end date. This may include presumptive renewal amendments; however, renewals are certified by the Procurement Commissioner on an annual basis and should not always be assumed to occur.<br /><br />The amount listed for sole source contracts is the total amount authorized for the contract terms to date. For example, if a sole source contract has a term of 7/1/07 to 6/30/11, the contract amount listed is for contract terms from 7/1/07 to 6/30/11.<br /><br />The payments listed are all payments from the beginning of the contract term through the end of the reportable quarter. This includes contract terms prior to the current active amendment term.",

If the current term amended a previous contract during its term (e.g. to modify the scope of services), the entry reflects the terms of the current contract, as so amended.<br /><br />Contracts that show a $0 dollar contract amount may reflect instances in which payments are not rendered through any appropriations or in which the original contract was amended to extend the contract term without additional money added.<br /><br />Contracts that show payments greater than the contract amount may reflect the following: instances in which payments for services rendered under a prior contract term are being made during the reporting period; or, instances in which payments are not rendered through the City of Philadelphia's Financial Accounting Management Information System.<br /><br />Negative contract amounts reflect instances in which the amendment reduced the amount of the prior contract term.<br /><br />'General Consultant Services under $30,000' are contracts for $30,000 or less and may include, but are not limited to, services in the following categories: architect and engineer services, audio visual and display services, behavioral health-mental retardation services, computer and information services, health-related services, homelessness-related services, general consultant services, legal services, and personnel-related services.<br /><br />Information on sole source contracts, managed by the Procurement Department, is extracted from several information systems. Due to limitations with these specific systems, it is difficult to obtain the same information for these contracts as for other non- competitively bid contracts. Below you will find an explanation of the difference in the information presented.<br /><br />Certain sole source contracts are displayed as four-year contracts, due to limitations in the reporting systems; however, all sole source contracts are subject to the same renewal provisions as other contracts (one base year term with three options to renew for additional year-long terms). No sole source contract term (unless noted) is for greater than twelve months.<br /><br />The days remaining column is calculated using the stated end date. This may include presumptive renewal amendments; however, renewals are certified by the Procurement Commissioner on an annual basis and should not always be assumed to occur.<br /><br />The amount listed for sole source contracts is the total amount authorized for the contract terms to date. For example, if a sole source contract has a term of 7/1/07 to 6/30/11, the contract amount listed is for contract terms from 7/1/07 to 6/30/11.<br /><br />The payments listed are all payments from the beginning of the contract term through the end of the reportable quarter. This includes contract terms prior to the current active amendment term.",

The initiative is a joint effort among Temple University’s Center for Asian Health, the Asian Community Health Coalition, the Philadelphia Chinese Restaurant Association, and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. Excess consumption of sodium (salt) and tobacco use are two major contributors to hypertension, heart disease and stroke. Chinese take-out restaurant dishes can have large amounts of sodium mainly due to the sauces used in preparation and cooking. And Chinese take-out restaurants tend to have higher rates of illegal tobacco sales to minors than other retailers.

The Philadelphia Healthy Chinese Take-out Initiative is working to prevent and control high blood pressure in Philadelphia residents by 1) reducing the sodium content in Chinese take-out dishes by 10-15% and 2) decreasing access to tobacco products. The initiative is a joint effort among Temple University’s Center for Asian Health, the Asian Community Health Coalition, the Philadelphia Chinese Restaurant Association, and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. Excess consumption of sodium (salt) and tobacco use are two major contributors to hypertension, heart disease and stroke. Chinese take-out restaurant dishes can have large amounts of sodium mainly due to the sauces used in preparation and cooking. And Chinese take-out restaurants tend to have higher rates of illegal tobacco sales to minors than other retailers. To date, 200 Chinese take-out restaurants have enrolled in the initiative, participated in a low-sodium healthy cooking training with a professional chef, and received education about complying with the Tobacco Youth Sales Law.",

        "notes": "City of Philadelphia land use as ascribed to individual parcel boundaries or units of land. Land use is the type of activity occurring on the land such as residential, commercial or industrial. Each unit of land is assigned one of nine major classifications of land use (2-digit code), and where possible a more narrowly defined sub-classification (3-digit code). The land use feature class has been field checked and corrected for the following Planning Districts. The year of the update is in parentheses: <br /><br />Central (2012) <br />Central Northeast (2013) <br />Lower North (2013) <br />Lower Northeast (2012) <br />Lower Northwest (2013)<br />Lower South (2011) <br />River Wards (2014)<br />South (2014)<br />West Park (2011) <br />University Southwest (2012) <br /><br />Field checks and updates are planned for the 11 remaining Planning Districts as part of the Philadelpia2035 comprehensive planning process.<br /><br />Citywide land use as determined by the City Philadelphia Planning Commission (PCPC). Prepared for Philadelphia2035, the City’s comprehensive development plan, to support the zoning reform remapping and the District Planning projects. For more information on the Philadelphia2035 comprehensive planning process, see www.phila2035.org <br />Land use classifications are activity-based.

The layer was created from the DOR_PARCELS layer in 2005 after it was decided that none of the other City parcel layers could meet the needs of PWD's stormwater billing program.  Those needs are generally that the parcel delineations match up to what people actually own, that there is an accurate assessment of the impervious area on the parcel, and that there is owner information associated with the parcel.  Over the past 5 years, PWD has made corrections based off deeds on file with DOR, BRT information, and other City records.  PWD also matched up each DOR parcel to a corresponding BRT record that contained the owner information for that parcel.",
