Land use is the type of activity occurring on the land such as residential, commercial or industrial. Each unit of land is assigned one of nine major classifications of land use (2-digit code), and where possible a more narrowly defined sub-classification (3-digit code). The land use feature class has been field checked and corrected for the following Planning Districts. The year of the update is in parentheses: <br /><br />Central (2012) <br />Central Northeast (2013) <br />Lower North (2013) <br />Lower Northeast (2012) <br />Lower Northwest (2013)<br />Lower South (2011) <br />River Wards (2014)<br />South (2014)<br />West Park (2011) <br />University Southwest (2012) <br /><br />Field checks and updates are planned for the 11 remaining Planning Districts as part of the Philadelpia2035 comprehensive planning process.<br /><br />Citywide land use as determined by the City Philadelphia Planning Commission (PCPC). Prepared for Philadelphia2035, the City’s comprehensive development plan, to support the zoning reform remapping and the District Planning projects. For more information on the Philadelphia2035 comprehensive planning process, see www.phila2035.org <br />Land use classifications are activity-based. Each land unit has only one land use designation interpreted by a 1, 2 or 3-digit code. Specificity of a land use description increases from the one to three digit code. Example: 1= Residential, 1.2 = Residential Medium Density, and 1.2.1 = Residential Rowhouse.<br />Land use features are derived from Philadelphia Water Department tax parcel boundaries (2009 to current release date) and from other GIS datasets prepared by City departments including: planimetric features, transportation right-of-ways (ROW), parks and open space, and water. Land use boundaries are typically coincident with PWD tax parcel boundaries, where tax parcel boundaries are available to define units of land. In some cases multiple land activities on a single parcel and been individual represented as individual polygons of land use. <br />This land use feature class is under revision through 2014. Updates will be made to correct attributes and features and to populate 3-digit codes based upon field verifications made by PCPC staff. Land use field surveys will be conducted for each of the 18 Planning District beginning in 2011 as part of the Philadelphia2035 Compressive Planning process.

The primary purpose of PWD_PARCEL layer is to calculate parcel-based stormwater charges for PWD customers under the new parcel-based stormwater billing program.  The layer was created from the DOR_PARCELS layer in 2005 after it was decided that none of the other City parcel layers could meet the needs of PWD's stormwater billing program.  Those needs are generally that the parcel delineations match up to what people actually own, that there is an accurate assessment of the impervious area on the parcel, and that there is owner information associated with the parcel.  Over the past 5 years, PWD has made corrections based off deeds on file with DOR, BRT information, and other City records.  PWD also matched up each DOR parcel to a corresponding BRT record that contained the owner information for that parcel.",

The State FAM layer is derived from the Street Centerline using data from PennDOT, who maintains the official State and FAM network designations and Federal Functional Class. A few notes about the fields in order to use the layer correctly. The ST_RT_NO is a combination of FAM, Bridges, and State Routes. In order for you to just see State Routes or FAM or Bridges please use the JURIS field. The JURIS field stands for Jurisdiction and enables the user to identify FAM ('5'), State Routes ('1') and Toll Bridges ('6') through a Definition Query. Ex. JURIS = '1' means that only the State Routes will be shown. The State FAM layer was developed to aid various city agencies with planning, organizing, and maintaining the streets of the City of Philadelphia.  These agencies include PWD, PCPC, Police, BRT, Health, etc.",
